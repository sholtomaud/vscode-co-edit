\subsection{Background}
\label{subsec:background}

The author of this project started by exploring the topic mainly through the works of Howard Thomas Odum. Although Odum is considered an ecologist, his work was not limited to ecology. Rather his work might be best considered as a part of the domain of Systems Theory. Odum's work is characterized by a holistic approach to understanding complex systems, emphasizing the interconnections and interactions within those systems. This perspective is crucial for addressing the multifaceted challenges faced in various fields, including ecology, economics, and social sciences.
